# Maple Language

The goal of Maple is to be a cross-platform, low level capable programming
language that is enjoyable to write and also easy to control at a higher level
of abstraction.

## Status
Maple is currently a work in progress side-project for myself. If you like what
you see and want to help, your contributions are welcome!

## Example Maple Code
Take a look in `examples/maple-code/prototypes` for all the conceptual Maple
code that has been written so far.
